# Network Project - Cisco Packet Tracer (ENCS3320)

## Project Description
This project is part of the ENCS3320 Computer Networks course at Birzeit University. The goal is to design and simulate a complete network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer, including subnetting, routing, and wireless configuration.

## Objectives
- Design an IP addressing scheme using subnetting
- Build and simulate a network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer
- Configure routing using OSPF protocol
- Configure wired and wireless networks
- Test network connectivity using ping and tracert
- Gain practical experience in network configuration

## Network Structure
The network consists of three main areas:

- Area 0: Central Campus Network
- Area 20: West Network
- Area 30: East Network
- ISP Network for external connectivity

Each area includes routers, switches, PCs, laptops, and wireless devices.

## Main Tasks
### 1. IP Subnetting
- Calculate subnet masks
- Assign network IP addresses
- Define usable IP ranges and broadcast addresses

### 2. Topology Design
- Add routers, switches, access points, PCs, laptops, and smartphones
- Assign static IP addresses
- Configure wireless access points

### 3. Routing Configuration
- Configure OSPF routing protocol
- Assign routers to correct OSPF areas
- Enable communication between all networks

### 4. Testing
- Test connectivity using ping
- Verify routing tables
- Ensure full communication between all devices
